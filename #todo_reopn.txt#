## TO DO ##

* change instance of \partial to L

* don't use the term open objects, only structured cospans.  Can use open(x) when x is a specific network, as in Open(Petri)

* don't Æ’ use category name L-Open.  Actually, maybe in my case, we can use that since the structured cospans areobjects in that categoryf
