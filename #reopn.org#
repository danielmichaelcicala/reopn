* want to study systems locally
* this means compositionally
* define sructured cospans as syntax
* syntax needs rewriting
** 
* use dpo rewriting on topos + rewriting relation
* define grammars (X,P) where X has systems and P is rules set
* to study these locally, want to decompose systems and rewrites
* follow gadducci/heckle model
* enter structured cospans
* RESULT: StrCsp_L is a topos so we can do rewriting
* define structred cpsan grammars adn their language
* RESULT: discrete grammar same rwrite rel as grammar
* RESULT: language for (StrCsp_L,P^) characterizes rewrite rel for (X,P)
