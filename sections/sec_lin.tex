\begin{df} \label{df_dbl-mon-rewrite-obcat}
	Consider, again, a cocartesian category with pullbacks $ (\A , + , 0_\A , \tau_\A ) $ that is locally cartesian closed and a monoidal category $ ( \core (\Span (\A)) , \otimes , I , \tau ) $ as in Lemma \ref{lem_IRewrite-obcat}.
\end{df}

\begin{lem} \label{thm_dbl-mon-rewrite-arrcat}
	Let $ (\A , + , 0_\A , \tau_\A ) $ be as in Lemma \ref{df_dbl-mon-rewrite-obcat}. Let $ (\X , + , 0_\X , \tau_\X ) $ be a topos that is symmetric monoidal with respect to the coproduct. Let $ L \from \A \to \X $ be a cocartesian functor that preserves pullbacks. 
	
	There is a symmetric monoidal category $ ( \C , \otimes , I , \tau ) $ defined as follows:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $ \C $ has $ L $-structured cospans \edit{open objects?} for objects and isomorphism classes of spans of $ L $-structured cospans \[ \diagram{diag_lr_dbl-mon-rewrite-2cell} \]
		where $ f $, $ f' $, $ g $, and $ g' $ are invertible. The arrows marked ``$ \rightarrowtail $'' are monic and an isomorphism of $ L $-structured cospans is an invertible $ \X $-arrow $ y \to y' $ that fits into the commuting pasting diagram obtained by identifying the outer squares of the spans of $ L $-structured cospans \[ \diagram{diag_lr_dbl-mon-rewrite-iso-sp-csp} \]
		\item $ \otimes $ is given by \[ \diagram{diag_lr_dbl-rewrite-tensor} \]
		\item $ I $ is given by a pair of identities on $ L0_A $
		\item $ \tau $ is given by \[ \diagram{diag_lr_dbl-rewrite-braiding} \]
	\end{itemize}
\end{lem}

\begin{comment} % casual description of IMonRewrite 
	 Denote by $ \MMonRewrite_{L} $ the double category with $ \A $-objects as 0-cells, spans in $ \A $ with invertible legs as vertical 1-cells, $ L $-structured cospans as horizontal 1-cells, and commuting diagrams in $ \X $ of form	\[ \diagram{diag_lr_dbl-mon-rewrite-2cell} \]
\end{comment}

\begin{lem} \label{df_dbl-mon-rewrite-isSMC} 
	Let $ (\A , + , 0_\A , \tau_\A ) $ be as in Lemma \ref{df_dbl-mon-rewrite-obcat}. Let $ (\X , + , 0_\X , \tau_\X ) $ be a topos that is symmetric monoidal with respect to the coproduct. Let $ L \from \A \to \X $  be a cocartesian functor that preserves pullbacks.  There is symmetry monoidal double category $ (\MMonRewrite_{L} , \otimes , I , \tau) $. The double category $ \MMonRewrite_{L} $ consists of the object category $ \MM_0 \coloneqq \core (\Span (\A)) $; arrow category $ \MM_1 \coloneqq \C $; unit functor $ U \from \MM_0 \to \MM_1 $ defined by \[ \diagram{diag_lr_dbl-mon-rewrite-unit-functor} \]; source and target functors $ S , T \from \MM_1 \to \MM_0 $ respectively defined by 
	\[
		\diagram{diag_lr_dbl-mon-rewrite-source-functor}
		\quad \text{and} \quad
		\diagram{diag_lr_dbl-mon-rewrite-target-functor}
	\]
	and composition functor $ \odot \from \MM_1 \times_{\MM_0} \MM_1 \to \MM_1 $ defined by \[ \diagram{diag_lr_dbl-mon-rewrite-composition-functor} \] which uses pushouts in $ \X $ and their universal properties.  The tensor, monoidal unit, and braiding are given as in Lemma \ref{thm_dbl-mon-rewrite-arrcat}.	
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
	\edit{say why compositie gives monics.}
\end{proof}

\begin{thm} \label{thm_dbl-mon-rewrite_isIsofib}
	The double category $ \MMonRewrite{L} $ is isofibrant.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
	A companion for the vertical 1-cell $ a \xto{f} b \xgets{g} c $ is the same as used in Theorem \ref{thm_rewrite-isofibrant}.  
	
	\edit{remains to show the equations hold}
\end{proof}

\begin{thm} \label{thm_bi-mon-rewrite-isSMCC}
	Let $ (\A, \otimes_{ \A }, I_{ \A }) $ and $ (\X, \otimes_{\X}, I_{\X}) $ be symmetric monoidal categories where $ \A $ has pullbacks and $ \X $ is a topos. Let $ L \from (\A, \otimes_{ \A }, I_{ \A }) \to (\X, \otimes_{\X}) $ be an adjunction where $ L $ preserves pullbacks.
	
	The horizontal edge bicategory $ \MonRewrite{L} \coloneqq  \mathcal{H} \left( \MMonRewrite{L} \right) $ in the sense of Shulman is symmetric monoidal.  Moreover, if the monoidal products $ \otimes_{\A} $ and $ \otimes_{\X} $ are coproducts, then the symmetric monoidal bicategory $ \MonRewrite{L} $ is compact closed.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}
	Suppose each element from a grammar $ \Gamma $ in $ \Cospan_{L} $ is of the form 
	\[
	\begin{tikzpicture}
	\node (a) at (-1,1) {$ L a $};
	\node (x) at (1,1) {$ x $};
	\node (a') at (3,1) {$ L a' $};
	\node (b) at (-1,-1) {$ L b $};
	\node (y) at (1,-1) {$ y $};
	\node (b') at (3,-1) {$ L b' $};
	\node (c) at (-1,-3) {$ L c $};
	\node (z) at (1,-3) {$ z $};
	\node (c') at (3,-3) {$ L c' $};
	%
	\draw [->] (a) to (x);
	\draw [->] (a') to (x);
	\draw [->] (b) to (y);
	\draw [->] (b') to (y);
	\draw [->] (c) to (z);
	\draw [->] (c') to (z);
	\draw [->] (b) to node [left] {$ \cong $} (a);
	\draw [->] (b) to node [left] {$ \cong $} (c);
	\draw [>->] (y) to (x);
	\draw [>->] (y) to (z);
	\draw [->] (b') to node [right] {$ \cong $} (a');
	\draw [->] (b') to node [right] {$ \cong $} (c');
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\]
	then $ \Gamma $ generates a sub-double category $ \langle \langle \Gamma \rangle \rangle $ of $ \MMonRewrite_{L} $.  The recipe is get the language $ \mathcal{L}(\Gamma)  \subseteq \Span {(\Cospan_{L})} $. Form the category as described in Definition \ref{df:ArrCatMonRwrt} from $ \mathcal{L}(\Gamma) $. Pair this, as an arrow category, with the object category $ \core (\Span_{\A}) $.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}
	Same as above with monics thrown in.
\end{thm}
