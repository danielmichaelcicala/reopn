\begin{abstract}
  To foster the study of networks on an abstract level, we
  further study the formalism of \emph{structured cospans}
  introduced by Baez and Courser. A structured cospan is a
  diagram of the form $ La \to x \gets Lb $ built from a
  geometric morphism with left exact left adjoint
  $ L \dashv R \from \X \to \A $.  We show that this
  construction is functorial and results in a topos with
  structured cospans for objects.  Additionally, structured
  cospans themselves are compositional. Combining these two
  perspectives, we define a double category of structured
  cospans.  We then leverage adhesive categories to create a
  theory of rewriting for structured cospans. We generalize
  the result from graph rewriting stating that a graph
  grammar induces the same rewrite relation as its
  underlying graph grammar.  We use this fact to prove our
  main result, a complete characterization of the rewriting
  relation for a topos $ \X $ using double categories.  This
  provides a compositional framework for rewriting systems.
